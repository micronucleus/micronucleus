Before contributing, please keep in mind the following:

 - The development branch of micronucleus is called "testing" and contains all
   the latest changes. You can check it out with "git checkout testing" or using
   a graphical git tools. 
   https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus/tree/testing
 
 - Please commit contributions as a pull request to "testing" so there is less
   trouble with merging. Alternatively, if you only have small changes, just
   open an issue and one of the maintainers will add it manually.
   https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus/issues
   
 - Have a look at License.txt

 - If you're going to write or change C or Ruby code, read Style Guide.txt
 
 - When writing commit messages, please prefix your message with one of these:
	   firmware:
	   upgrade:
	   commandline:
	   ruby:
	   tests:
	 This will help us all understand what your commit is primarily in relation
	 to when reading through the commit history hunting for specific changes.

 - Please clean up your code-base before commits and make sure that the commit 
   relates to the intended changes only. E.g. remnants of spurious edits like
   randoms spaces or inserted/deleted lines should be avoided unless they are
   part of intentional refactoring.

 - This repository is for source code only. There are some exceptions, but these
   are mostly legacy and in some cases relate to constraints that existed in the past. 
   If you can contribute by cleaning up, this is highly appreciated!

   Some notes regarding this:
   - Documentation that is not directly relevant to the bootloader and compiling it
     should go into the Wiki or elsewhere
   - Executables should never be part of the repository. Releases are automatically
     deployed as archives in the github release section.
   - Currently the hex files are stored in the repository as a legacy. It would be
     preferable to also build them using a CDCI process. This is work in progress.
   - All documentation should use standard ASCII or proper markdown.
   - Platform dependent build scripts should be avoided.
